# buffercount-flag.vim: Tiny buffer count flag

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/hugoh/vim-buffercount-flag/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/hugoh/vim-buffercount-flag/commits/master)

This plugin offers a very simple buffer count indicator that one can add to their status line, tab line, etc.

By defaut, it will look like `[B:5]` for 5 buffers, but can be customized at will.
